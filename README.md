Python Image library for GASMIX EUDP Distro (PImGED) is used for handling image data collected 
during the experiments of the GASMIX project supported by EUDP, MAN ES and DTU. 

The framework is designed to handle large amounts of image data with limited computational 
resources. Several optimized function utilizing OpenCV C++, numba compilation and multithreading 
through the Joblib package, are used to speed-up computations and memory handling.
